# skip-list-dsa

SkipList is a fast, pure Python implementation of an indexable skiplist. It implements a SkipList data structure that provides an always sorted, list-like data structure for (key, value) pairs. It efficiently supports the following operations:
Insert a pair in the list, maintaining sorted order.
Find the value of a given key.
Remove a given pair based on a key.
Iterate over all pairs in sorted order.
Find the position of a given key.
Access a pair at a certain position.
Delete a pair at a certain position.

Asymptotic Complexity
Below are the Big-O complexities of the various operations implemented by pyskiplist:
1. insertion = O(log N)
2. search by key = O(log N)
3. removal by key = O(log N)
4. forward iteration = O(1)
5. find by position = O(log N)
6. access by position = O(log N)
7. delete by position = O(log N)
